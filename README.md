# tiny-db
simple key value pair DB server in rust , to demonstrate the idea of tokio async pattern
//! A "tiny database" and accompanying protocol
//!
//! This example shows the usage of shared state amongst all connected clients,
//! namely a database of key/value pairs. Each connected client can send a
//! series of GET/SET commands to query the current value of a key or set the
//! value of a key.
//!
//! This example has a simple protocol you can use to interact with the server.
//! To run, first run this in one terminal window:
//!
//!     cargo run --example tinydb
//!
//! and next in another windows run:
//!
//!     cargo run --example connect 127.0.0.1:8080
//!
//! In the `connect` window you can type in commands where when you hit enter
//! you'll get a response from the server for that command. An example session
//! is:
//!
//!
//!     $ cargo run --example connect 127.0.0.1:8080
//!     GET foo
//!     foo = bar
//!     GET FOOBAR
//!     error: no key FOOBAR
//!     SET FOOBAR my awesome string
//!     set FOOBAR = `my awesome string`, previous: None
//!     SET foo tokio
//!     set foo = `tokio`, previous: Some("bar")
//!     GET foo
//!     foo = tokio
//!
//! Namely you can issue two forms of commands:
//!
//! * `GET $key` - this will fetch the value of `$key` from the database and
//!   return it. The server's database is initially populated with the key `foo`
//!   set to the value `bar`
//! * `SET $key $value` - this will set the value of `$key` to `$value`,
//!   returning the previous value, if any.
